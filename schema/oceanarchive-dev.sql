For Braudel, geography and climatic conditions play a fundamental role in the formation of civilizations and the sea stands as “the best witness to the Mediterranean’s age-old past.”<sup>2</sup> If biogeochemical cycles are at the foreground of the history of the region, what are the consequences of these cycles shifting because of new anthropogenic conditions? What are the speculations and the resulting conflations of issues and urgencies that reorganize the contemporary Mediterranean and the societies that surround it?<sup>3</sup></p><p>The North Sea to Red Sea trajectory traverses Braudelian historical centers of world-system capitalist economy, beginning with the maritime powers of the North Sea such as Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and London, crossing Venice, and beyond the Adriatic toward Cairo and the Gulf of Aden. The contemporary transportation roads that link the North Sea to the Gulf of Aden through the Adriatic and the Strait of Gibraltar reveal how these historical centers of maritime-based capitalist economies continue to be interlinked by the same shipping routes that structured pre-industrial economic relations.</p><p>Venice occupies a central position in this analysis. It is the home of TBA21–Academy’s Ocean Space and one of the sites from which “Ocean in Transformation” originates. Venice has been a maritime city for hundreds of years and as Braudel writes, a model for the kinds of spatial organization and integration described by the trajectory: “By 1450, the itineraries of the state galleys alone, that is Venice’s official shipping, would if drawn on a map look very like an octopus, with tentacles reaching into the entire area penetrated by Italians outside the peninsula.”<sup>4</sup></p><p>To address the fundamental question of what “drives” the accelerated, unpredictable, and unregulated transformation of the world oceans, the multiple trajectories of “Oceans in Transformation” strongly lean on the earth-system theory known as the Gaia hypothesis, developed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis. The Gaia theory depicts the earth as synergistic and self-regulating system that created and perpetuates the conditions for life on the planet. The underlying idea of a responsive cohesion between organic existence and inorganic matter propositions a new form of organization of life. Rather than partitioning different registers of knowledge and scientific findings, the Gaia proponents argue for an aggregated understanding of sets of relations that includes earth, ocean, life, climate, atmosphere, inorganic chemistry, microbiology, and so on. According to Lovelock, the earth system “is an ‘emergent domain’—a system that has emerged from the reciprocal evolution of organisms and their environment over the eons of life on earth. In this system, the self-regulation of climate and chemical composition are entirely automatic. Self-regulation emerges as the system evolves.”<sup>5</sup></p><p>A human-inclusive earth system implies that global-scale social and economic processes—the human imprint—are now becoming significant features in the system’s functioning. As the hyper-connectivity of the human enterprise intersects with the pressures on the earth system, concatenated global crises can propagate rapidly through the system—the fundamental proposition of the Anthropocene concept. In terms of planetary stewardship, the ocean carries much of the load in the functioning of the earth system: it modulates climate variability, provides the moisture for most rainfall, and stores much more carbon than the land and atmosphere combined.</p><p>The multiple agencies acting upon the planet as nature-cultural artefacts and forces are registered in this study as the enmeshed conditions causing the intolerable degradation of the oceans. Pivoting between world and earth science and resting on knowledge produced by philosophy, the humanities, indigenous thinking, and the arts, “Oceans in Transformation” is, according to curator Anselm Franke, “a border operation that works at the edge of disciplinary languages, of readability, of protocols and knowledges. It has its place in the in-between of languages, at the fringe of the linguistic conventions and disciplinary universes, where lived practice and expert discourse expose their inevitable gaps.”<sup>6</sup></p><p>While offering a dynamic view of these forces, this trajectory allows anthropogenic stressors affecting the earth system to enter the equation along with historical and social transformations: the discharge of ballast waters and the dispersal of invasive species; trawling; overfishing; oil licensing in the North Sea; chemical and conventional ammunition dumping in the Baltic, North, and Celtic Seas, along the Iberian Coast, and in the Mediterranean; the melting of the permafrost and glaciers of the Alps; hypoxia in the Po delta; migration emergencies on Europe’s borders, including the dispersed refugee camps and detention centers in Turkey and Greece triggered by the EU’s security crackdown; the erosion of the Nile valley; and the oil supply chain in the Red Sea. These factors all contribute directly or indirectly to the anthropogenic forcing that marks the overall change in the earth’s energy balance due to human (economical) activities.</p><p>//</p><p><sup>1</sup> Immanuel Wallerstein, Immanuel Maurice Wallerstein, <em>The End of the World as We Know It: Social Science for the Twenty-First Century</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1999), 192.<br><sup>2</sup> Fernand Braudel, <em>Memory and the Mediterranean</em> (New York: Vintage, 2002 [1998]).<br><sup>3</sup> Adrian Lahoud, “The Mediterranean: A new imaginary,” New Geographies 05: The Mediterranean, ed.

The decision of the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf Cases is a cause célèbre for its articulation of important principles relating to the doctrine of the Continental Shelf. Beyond matters of law, the court’s ruling implicated important notions as regards the “ideology”<sup>1</sup> of national sovereignty over submarine areas and resources, the importance of geology and geomorphology in the classification of national territory, and the effect of customs on international treaties.</p><p>Indeed, the court’s approach was to conceptualize the continental shelf as the “natural prolongation”<sup>2</sup> of the coastal state’s land territory. This proposition went against the standing definition of the concept enshrined in the UN Convention on the Continental Shelf from 1958. The 1958 convention placed the seaward limit of the continental shelf at the point where the waters reach a depth of 200 meters or, beyond that limit, where the depth of the waters permits exploitation of the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil.<sup>3</sup> The boundless possibilities of exploitation of the continental shelf, only limited by technological advancement, was driven by the discoveries of oil and gas in coastal waters.<sup>4</sup></p><p>By introducing the concept of natural prolongation, rather than using a fixed measurement uncoupled from the shelf’s geomorphology (based on the idea of proximity and equity between neighboring states rather than geology), the court limited the extent to which exploitation was permitted. However, and most importantly, the decision promoted the new idea that the coastal state has an inherent entitlement over the continental shelf—its title of sovereignty—over the territory lying above the sea. “Τo the extent that the state enjoys sovereignty over land territory, it enjoys title over the areas which, although covered with seawater, ‘may be deemed to be actually part of [that] territory,’ in the sense that they are an extension—a prolongation—of that territory under the sea.”<sup>5</sup> In consequence, the court asserted the principle that the land dominates the sea.<sup>6</sup></p><p> The ICJ’s opinion was reconsidered in the process of revision of the definition of the continental shelf during the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea. According to the UNCLOS doctrine, the state’s sovereignty is delimited by its territorial waters that extend to 12 nautical miles from the coast. The continental shelf (i.e. a state’s Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ]) extends throughout the natural prolongation of the coastal state’s land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baseline.<sup>7</sup> Within the EEZ, a state enjoys undivided rights (however not full sovereignty) over marine resources as well as rights of energy production.<sup>8</sup> In the case that a country’s so-called “outer continental shelf” exceeds 200nm (based on geological features), countries have rights of the seabed of up to 350 nautical miles from the baseline.</p><p>This new definition cites the concept of “natural prolongation,” however, it bases the EEZ on a fixed distance criterion. Distance from baseline provides the new legal basis for the entitlement to continental shelf rights, with exception of the outer shelf limit. By decoupling the definition of the continental shelf from geology, UNCLOS introduces the new paradigm of the baselines. Ironically, the concept of the baseline relies even more precariously on geomorphological features than the previous ICJ opinion. According to Vidas, this concept opens a set of new issues, directly related to the Anthropocene transformation of the oceans. “What is the cornerstone of the entire building of the law of the sea, of its core architecture, is something that is called baseline. Baseline is, in many respects, coast. It’s called normal baseline. Or it can be a certain geometrical line which connects features of indented coast.”<sup>9</sup></p><p>The entire “architectural construction” of a right over territory relies on the assumption of stability, considering the coast as an objective, stable criterion for demarcation. The assumption of stability is based on the continuous conditions of the Holocene, as recorded over the past 11,700 years. But what will happen when the sea level rises in unpredictable ways in the coming years? If island nations disappear, if their habitation can no longer be sustained, and if states claim that certain, uninhabited island formations are part of their borders? Addressing the challenges posed by the anthropogenic transformations restructuring conditions on the planet, their consequences for international law, the law of the sea and human rights, Vidas foresees great challenges and reconsiderations of the way in which international law asserts sovereign rights over territory. In such future expressions, geology might find a new relevance for the future development of international law.</p><p>//</p><p><sup>1</sup> Territorial Agency, Interview with Davor Vidas, Fridtjof Nansen Institute, Oslo, November 5, 2013.

However, and most importantly, the decision promoted the new idea that the coastal state has an inherent entitlement over the continental shelf—its title of sovereignty—over the territory lying above the sea. “Τo the extent that the state enjoys sovereignty over land territory, it enjoys title over the areas which, although covered with seawater, ‘may be deemed to be actually part of [that] territory,’ in the sense that they are an extension—a prolongation—of that territory under the sea.”<sup>5</sup> In consequence, the court asserted the principle that the land dominates the sea.<sup>6</sup></p><p> The ICJ’s opinion was reconsidered in the process of revision of the definition of the continental shelf during the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea. According to the UNCLOS doctrine, the state’s sovereignty is delimited by its territorial waters that extend to 12 nautical miles from the coast. The continental shelf (i.e. a state’s Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ]) extends throughout the natural prolongation of the coastal state’s land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baseline.<sup>7</sup> Within the EEZ, a state enjoys undivided rights (however not full sovereignty) over marine resources as well as rights of energy production.<sup>8</sup> In the case that a country’s so-called “outer continental shelf” exceeds 200nm (based on geological features), countries have rights of the seabed of up to 350 nautical miles from the baseline.</p><p>This new definition cites the concept of “natural prolongation,” however, it bases the EEZ on a fixed distance criterion. Distance from baseline provides the new legal basis for the entitlement to continental shelf rights, with exception of the outer shelf limit. By decoupling the definition of the continental shelf from geology, UNCLOS introduces the new paradigm of the baselines. Ironically, the concept of the baseline relies even more precariously on geomorphological features than the previous ICJ opinion. According to Vidas, this concept opens a set of new issues, directly related to the Anthropocene transformation of the oceans. “What is the cornerstone of the entire building of the law of the sea, of its core architecture, is something that is called baseline. Baseline is, in many respects, coast. It’s called normal baseline. Or it can be a certain geometrical line which connects features of indented coast.”<sup>9</sup></p><p>The entire “architectural construction” of a right over territory relies on the assumption of stability, considering the coast as an objective, stable criterion for demarcation. The assumption of stability is based on the continuous conditions of the Holocene, as recorded over the past 11,700 years. But what will happen when the sea level rises in unpredictable ways in the coming years? If island nations disappear, if their habitation can no longer be sustained, and if states claim that certain, uninhabited island formations are part of their borders? Addressing the challenges posed by the anthropogenic transformations restructuring conditions on the planet, their consequences for international law, the law of the sea and human rights, Vidas foresees great challenges and reconsiderations of the way in which international law asserts sovereign rights over territory. In such future expressions, geology might find a new relevance for the future development of international law.</p><p>//</p><p><sup>1</sup> Territorial Agency, Interview with Davor Vidas, Fridtjof Nansen Institute, Oslo, November 5, 2013.

The trajectory advocates for the development of a long-standing polity that will guide the process along the conditions.

The extreme city is an urban space marked by economic inequality and great unsustainability, pressured by water shortages, air pollution, heat waves, traffic chokes, sea level rise, ecological degradation and many other anthropogenic stressors. While some cities are better equipped and financially in the fortuitous position to possibly adopt preventive and mitigating measures, the top ten candidates are evenly distributed between developed and developing countries. Indeed, as Dawson argues, “how a city copes with stratifications of race, class, and gender (..) has everything to do with how well it will weather the storms that are bearing down on humanity.”Indeed the extreme city–not only in the global South–is where struggles will begin, especially in the rapidly urbanized coastal zones.</p><p>The Oceans in Transformation trajectories reveal that most major cities are located by the sea and many in low-level coastal zones. Coastal zones have experienced massive urban expansion in recent decades and are most prone to climate-related urban vulnerability. Asia’s unprecedented growth, with its urban population expected to reach 2.4 billion in 2030 is heavily at risk, with China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam currently at most risk of severe marine dangers. However, Africa is expected to experience the highest rates of population growth and migration to mega-delta cities in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and Eastern Africa. These countries are also characterised by very large extents of non-urban settlements in the low-lying coast areas.</p>	Courtesy of Territorial Agency and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Area of research	\N	1	0	1	\N	https://staging.ocean-archive.org/collection/25	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	f

As experienced dramatically by many people on the move, today’s Mediterranean is where Italy no longer meets Africa.

Its transformations are plural: they traverse a multiplicity of elements, circulations, life forms, environments, and operate across a gradient of dimensions, energies and time scales.

At the same time, they are more densely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates of population growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continue into the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affected by such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060. Starting from baseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assess future population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends in exposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level and socio-eco- nomic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth of coastal areas against the land-locked hinterland and for trends of urbanisation and expansive urban growth, as current- ly observed, but does not explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due to factors such as sea-level rise. We combine spatially explicit estimates of the baseline popula- tion with demographic data in order to derive scenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Our scenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevation coast- al zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking is expected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa is expected to experi- ence the highest rates of population growth and urbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and Eastern Africa. The results highlight countries and regions with a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and help identifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for building resilient coastal communities are not only desirable but essential. Furthermore, we identify needs for further research and scope for improvement in this kind of scenario-based exposure analysis.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the authors	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

This quantity is comparable to the positive vertical bias of the principle digital elevation model (DEM) used to assess global and national population exposures to extreme coastal water levels, NASA’s SRTM. CoastalDEM is a new DEM utilizing neural networks to reduce SRTM error. Here we show – employing CoastalDEM—that 190 M people (150–250 M, 90% CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110 M today, for a median increase of 80 M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630 M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340 M for mid-century, versus roughly 250 M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10 m above current high tide lines, including 230 M below 1 m.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the authors	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

For Braudel, geography and climatic conditions play a fundamental role in the formation of civilizations and the sea stands as “the best witness to the Mediterranean’s age-old past”.<sup>2</sup> If biogeochemical cycles are in the foreground of the history of the region, what consequences arise when these cycles and the oceanic hydrosphere start shifting into new anthropogenic conditions? What are the speculations and the resulting conflations of issues and urgencies that are reorganizing today’s Mediterranean and the polities connected to it?<sup>3</sup></p><p>To address the fundamental questions of what “drives” the accelerated, unpredictable and unregulated transformation of the world oceans, the multiple trajectories of OiT strongly lean on Earth-System theory, developed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis. The Gaia theory, as they named their hypothesis, depicts the earth as synergistic and self-regulating system that created and perpetuates the conditions for life on the planet. The underlying idea of a responsive cohesion between organic existence and inorganic matter propositions a new form of organization of life. Rather than segregating and partitioning different registers of knowledge and scientific findings, the Gaia proponents (as well as Territorial Agency) argue for an aggregated understanding of sets of relations — earth, ocean, life, climate, atmosphere, inorganic chemistry, microbiology. According to Lovelock, the Earth system “is an "emergent domain" – a system that has emerged from the reciprocal evolution of organisms and their environment over the eons of life on Earth. In this system, the self-regulation of climate and chemical composition are entirely automatic. Self-regulation emerges as the system evolves.”<sup>4</sup></p><p>A human-inclusive Earth System implies that global-scale social and economic processes–the human imprint–are now becoming significant features in its functioning. When the hyper-connectivity of the human enterprise intersects with the pressures on Earth System services, concatenated global crises can propagate rapidly through the system – the fundamental proposition of the Anthropocene concept. In terms of planetary stewardship, the ocean carries the load in the functioning of the Earth System; it modulates climate variability, provides the moisture for most of rainfall and stores much more carbon than the land and atmosphere combined.</p><p>With attention to both analytical frameworks, the multiple agencies acting upon the planet as nature-cultural artefacts and forces are registered in this study as the enmeshed conditions causing the intolerable degradation of the oceans. Pivoting between world and earth science and resting on the knowledges of philosophy, the humanities, indigenous thinking and the arts, the project, according to curator Anselm Franke, “is a border operation that works at the edge of disciplinary languages, of readability, of protocols and knowledges. It has its place in the in-between of languages, at the fringe of the linguistic conventions and disciplinary universes, where lived practice and expert discourse expose their inevitable gaps.”<sup>5</sup></p><p>The North Sea to Red Sea trajectory traverses Braudelian historical centers of world-system capitalist economy, beginning with the maritime powers of the North Sea such as Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and London, crossing Venice, and beyond the Adriatic reaching towards Cairo and the Gulf of Aden. The current transportation roads that link the North Sea to the Gulf of Aden through the Adriatic and the strait of Gibraltar reveal how these historical centers of maritime-based capitalist economies continue to be connected by the same shipping routes that structured pre-industrial economic relations. Venice occupies a central position in this analysis. It is the home of TBA21–Academy’s Ocean Space and one of the places from which this project has been conceived. Venice has been a maritime city for 1000 years and as Braudel writes, the city has been a model for the kinds of spatial organization and integration described by the trajectory: “By 1450, the itineraries of the state galleys alone, that is Venice’s official shipping, would if drawn on a map look very like an octopus, with tentacles reaching into the entire area penetrated by Italians outside the peninsula. (…) This map of the Venetian shipping routes gives a better idea than anything else could of the coordinated effort, the calculated penetration of space, and the superior command of the crucial transport sector that provided Italy for so long with its livelihood.”(6)</p><p>While offering an updated view of these dynamics, the trajectory allows anthropogenic stressors affecting the Earth System to enter the equation along with historical and social transformations: the discharge of ballast waters and the dispersal of invasive species; trawling; overfishing; oil licensing in the North Sea; chemical and conventional ammunition dumping in the Baltic, North and Celtic Seas, along the Iberian Coast and in the Mediterranean; the melting of the permafrost and glaciers of the Alps; hypoxia in the Po delta; migration emergencies arising on Europe’s borders and dispersed refugee camps and detention centers in Turkey and Greece, triggered by the EU’s security crackdown; the erosion of the Nile valley and the oil supply chain of the Red Sea. These factors all contribute directly or indirectly to the anthropogenic forcing, that marks the overall change in the Earth’s energy balance due to human (economical) activities.</p><p>Coastal digital elevation models (DEMs) that integrate ocean bathymetry and land topography are used for coastal process modelling (inundation, storm surge, sea-level rise, contaminant dispersal, etc.), ecosystems management and habitat research, coastal and marine spatial planning, hazard mitigation and community preparedness.</p><p>//</p><p><sup>1</sup> Wallerstein, Immanuel. <em>The End of the World as We Know It: Social Science for the Twenty-First Century</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1999), 192.<br><sup>2</sup> Braudel, Fernand. <em>Memory and the Mediterranean</em>, Vintage books, 2002 (originally 1998). 3 Lahoud, Adrian. “The Mediterranean: A new imaginary”.

While some cities are better equipped and financially in the fortuitous position to possibly adopt preventive and mitigating measures, the top ten candidates are evenly distributed between developed and developing countries. Indeed, as Dawson argues, “how a city copes with stratifications of race, class, and gender (..) has everything to do with how well it will weather the storms that are bearing down on humanity.”Indeed the extreme city–not only in the global South–is where struggles will begin, especially in the rapidly urbanized coastal zones.</p>	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Essay	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Daniela Zyman and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{3302,2470}	https://staging.ocean-archive.org/collection/27	\N	\N	\N

The coasts of the European peninsula are being rapidly transformed, with new intensified circulations of people, goods, and energy. The rapid rising of the sea, the overfishing of the continental shelf, new maritime infrastructures and protection zones are depicted in this cross-section of Europe as being intertwined with the complex turmoil shaping contemporary Europe. These transformations reverberate well beyond Europe and facilitate a new set of relations and exchanges.</p><p>The analysis draws inspiration from the ways the Venetian Republic developed a maritime-based polity. In this <em>longue durée</em> view, Venice acts both as an example and a warning: the rich environments of the lagoon are a fragile man-made system–supported by a sophisticated polity–, which has embraced over the last hundred years a disjoined set of measures, distancing the city from its waters and the relationships it entertained. As experienced dramatically by many people on the move, today’s Mediterranean is where Italy no longer meets Africa.<sup>1</sup> Along this trajectory we ask: How can the seas be remapped as the points of origin for new collaborations? How can contemporary polities be assembled to reshape vital coastal environments? And finally, is it possible to image Venice taking a leading role in fighting climate escalation in a burning world?</p><p>//</p><p><sup>1</sup> Alessandra Di Maio, “The Mediterranean, or Where Africa Does (Not) Meet Italy,” <em>The Cinemas of Italian Migration: European and Transatlantic Narratives</em>, ed.

Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic con- nectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distri- bution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the re- sponse of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment, particularly at large spa- tial and temporal scales. With the ongoing development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a press- ing need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning and eco- engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the authors	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

We assessed the impact of urbanization along an extensive latitudinal gradient encompassing three phycogeographical regions in the SW Atlantic. Human population density, number of dwellings, and terrestrial vegetation cover were determined for each survey area and correlated with diversity indices calculated from seaweed percent cover data. Urban areas had significantly lower calcar- eous algal cover (38%), and there was significantly less carbonate in the sediment off urban areas than off reference areas. Seaweed richness averaged 26% less in urban areas than in areas with higher vegeta- tion cover. We observed a remarkable decline in Phaeophyceae and a substantial increase of Chlorophyta in urban areas across a wide latitudinal gradient.

The coasts of the European peninsula are being rapidly transformed, with new intensified circulations of people, goods, and energy. The rapid rising of the sea, the overfishing of the continental shelf, new maritime infrastructures and protection zones are depicted in this cross-section of Europe as being intertwined with the complex turmoil shaping contemporary Europe. These transformations reverberate well beyond Europe and facilitate a new set of relations and exchanges.</p><p>The analysis draws inspiration from the ways the Venetian Republic developed a maritime-based polity. In this <em>longue durée</em> view, Venice acts both as an example and a warning: the rich environments of the lagoon are a fragile man-made system–supported by a sophisticated polity–, which has embraced over the last hundred years a disjoined set of measures, distancing the city from its waters and the relationships it entertained. As experienced dramatically by many people on the move, today’s Mediterranean is where Italy no longer meets Africa.<sup>1</sup> Along this trajectory we ask: How can the seas be remapped as the points of origin for new collaborations? How can contemporary polities be assembled to reshape vital coastal environments? And finally, is it possible to image Venice taking a leading role in fighting climate escalation in a burning world?</p><p>//</p><p><sup>1</sup> Alessandra Di Maio, “The Mediterranean, or Where Africa Does (Not) Meet Italy,” <em>The Cinemas of Italian Migration: European and Transatlantic Narratives</em>, ed.

For Braudel, geography and climatic conditions play a fundamental role in the formation of civilizations and the sea stands as “the best witness to the Mediterranean’s age-old past”. (2) If biogeochemical cycles are in the foreground of the history of the region, what consequences arise when these cycles and the oceanic hydrosphere start shifting into new anthropogenic conditions? What are the speculations and the resulting conflations of issues and urgencies that are reorganizing today’s Mediterranean and the polities connected to it?(3)</p><p>To address the fundamental questions of what “drives” the accelerated, unpredictable and unregulated transformation of the world oceans, the multiple trajectories of OiT strongly lean on Earth-System theory, developed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis. The Gaia theory, as they named their hypothesis, depicts the earth as synergistic and self-regulating system that created and perpetuates the conditions for life on the planet. The underlying idea of a responsive cohesion between organic existence and inorganic matter propositions a new form of organization of life. Rather than segregating and partitioning different registers of knowledge and scientific findings, the Gaia proponents (as well as Territorial Agency) argue for an aggregated understanding of sets of relations — earth, ocean, life, climate, atmosphere, inorganic chemistry, microbiology. According to Lovelock, the Earth system “is an "emergent domain" – a system that has emerged from the reciprocal evolution of organisms and their environment over the eons of life on Earth. In this system, the self-regulation of climate and chemical composition are entirely automatic. Self-regulation emerges as the system evolves.”(4)</p><p>A human-inclusive Earth System implies that global-scale social and economic processes–the human imprint–are now becoming significant features in its functioning. When the hyper-connectivity of the human enterprise intersects with the pressures on Earth System services, concatenated global crises can propagate rapidly through the system – the fundamental proposition of the Anthropocene concept. In terms of planetary stewardship, the ocean carries the load in the functioning of the Earth System; it modulates climate variability, provides the moisture for most of rainfall and stores much more carbon than the land and atmosphere combined.</p><p>With attention to both analytical frameworks, the multiple agencies acting upon the planet as nature-cultural artefacts and forces are registered in this study as the enmeshed conditions causing the intolerable degradation of the oceans. Pivoting between world and earth science and resting on the knowledges of philosophy, the humanities, indigenous thinking and the arts, the project, according to curator Anselm Franke, “is a border operation that works at the edge of disciplinary languages, of readability, of protocols and knowledges. It has its place in the in-between of languages, at the fringe of the linguistic conventions and disciplinary universes, where lived practice and expert discourse expose their inevitable gaps.”(5)</p><p>The North Sea to Red Sea trajectory traverses Braudelian historical centers of world-system capitalist economy, beginning with the maritime powers of the North Sea such as Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and London, crossing Venice, and beyond the Adriatic reaching towards Cairo and the Gulf of Aden. The current transportation roads that link the North Sea to the Gulf of Aden through the Adriatic and the strait of Gibraltar reveal how these historical centers of maritime-based capitalist economies continue to be connected by the same shipping routes that structured pre-industrial economic relations. Venice occupies a central position in this analysis. It is the home of TBA21–Academy’s Ocean Space and one of the places from which this project has been conceived. Venice has been a maritime city for 1000 years and as Braudel writes, the city has been a model for the kinds of spatial organization and integration described by the trajectory: “By 1450, the itineraries of the state galleys alone, that is Venice’s official shipping, would if drawn on a map look very like an octopus, with tentacles reaching into the entire area penetrated by Italians outside the peninsula. (…) This map of the Venetian shipping routes gives a better idea than anything else could of the coordinated effort, the calculated penetration of space, and the superior command of the crucial transport sector that provided Italy for so long with its livelihood.”(6)</p><p>While offering an updated view of these dynamics, the trajectory allows anthropogenic stressors affecting the Earth System to enter the equation along with historical and social transformations: the discharge of ballast waters and the dispersal of invasive species; trawling; overfishing; oil licensing in the North Sea; chemical and conventional ammunition dumping in the Baltic, North and Celtic Seas, along the Iberian Coast and in the Mediterranean; the melting of the permafrost and glaciers of the Alps; hypoxia in the Po delta; migration emergencies arising on Europe’s borders and dispersed refugee camps and detention centers in Turkey and Greece, triggered by the EU’s security crackdown; the erosion of the Nile valley and the oil supply chain of the Red Sea. These factors all contribute directly or indirectly to the anthropogenic forcing, that marks the overall change in the Earth’s energy balance due to human (economical) activities.</p><p>Coastal digital elevation models (DEMs) that integrate ocean bathymetry and land topography are used for coastal process modelling (inundation, storm surge, sea-level rise, contaminant dispersal, etc.), ecosystems management and habitat research, coastal and marine spatial planning, hazard mitigation and community preparedness.</p><p>//</p><p>1 Wallerstein, Immanuel. <em>The End of the World as We Know It: Social Science for the Twenty-First Century</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1999), 192.<br/>2 Braudel, Fernand. <em>Memory and the Mediterranean</em>, Vintage books, 2002 (originally 1998). 3 Lahoud, Adrian. “The Mediterranean: A new imaginary”.

The global ocean is changing its circulations, energies, interactions, and ecologies. It is the most dynamic and sensitive component of our living planet, yet the most unknown. The ocean is in a new phase of its always-changing history, shaped by the intensification of the impact of human activities on the earth system – the Anthropocene.</p><p>TBA21–Academy and Territorial Agency are collaborating to connect new forms of visibility and understanding of the ocean brought by science, culture, and art. The research project inquires into new ways of connecting research groups, cultures, and epistemes that address the ocean in transformation. Linking and interconnecting scientists, artists, policy makers, and conservationists by way of shared images, data sets, and narratives, the projects is structured as an instigation for new cognitive modes of encountering the ocean and a line toward attainable solutions.</p><p>The world ocean is undergoing major transformations, it is enveloped in an epochal shift following a long period of relative climatic stability. The transformations are plural: they traverse a multiplicity of elements, circulations, life forms, and environments and operate across a gradient of dimensions, energies, and rhythms. “Oceans in Transformation” assembles a variety of scientific data sets stemming from multiple research institutions to depict the magnitude of human impact on marine life. What emerges is a series of dynamic compositions that are disquieting and disorienting: the image of an empty ocean lingers on in many of us.</p><p>In anticipation of the exhibition “Oceans in Transformation” at Ocean Space in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice, we present a selection of the trajectories that structure the project on Ocean Archive. These trajectories, relating to and exploring the complex intersections of the transformation processes shaping the world-system and the Earth system, are the basis for an extensive online public program that asks how we can sense and make sensible the multiple transformations of the oceans, strengthen our understanding of the oceans, form new collaborations, and move together to safeguard the oceans’ many life forms. </p>	\N	1	1	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Territorial Agency and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1140,641}	\N	\N	\N	\N

The report gathered the findings of over 100 scientists, which together drew a catastrophic scene of planetary transformation due to the impact of human activities. The IPCC’s portrait of the oceans forces us to rethink, redraw, and recalibrate what we knew of the world’s hydrosphere and cryosphere. It is a record of the Anthropocene, registered in a “watery archive” that traverses a multiplicity of elements, circulations, life forms, and environments and intersects with a gradient of dimensions, energies, and temporalities. Perhaps the ocean’s warming, acidic, polluted, and oxygen-poor body will also makes us consider that we have been looking for too long at the wrong places, at the earth’s lithic crust rather than its aqueous and icy formations.</p>	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Essay	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Daniela Zyman and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{3324,2388}	https://staging.ocean-archive.org/collection/31	\N	\N	\N
